# Release notes for cobrapy 0.8.2

## Fixes

- the Solution class no longer contains links progenitor model's
  reactions and metabolites
- Guarantee that sampler._reproject always returns a feasible point
  and will not attempt to reproject already feasible
  points. [#564](https://github.com/opencobra/cobrapy/pull/564)
- `Model.summary` no longer fails when calling after the model has
  changed. Fixed by letting the summary function re-compute a solution
  (default) or letting user supply a prior computed solution
  object. [#566](https://github.com/opencobra/cobrapy/pull/566)
- Metabolites must now have valid identifiers before being added to a
  model or `ValueError` is raised.
- Fix use of underscores in key/value pairs in legacy sbml
  notes. [#547](https://github.com/opencobra/cobrapy/issues/547)
